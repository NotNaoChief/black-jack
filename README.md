# black-jack
Play Black Jack vs the computer. 
Bet, Hit, Stay, and win! Start with 100 chips and see how far you can
go, or how quick you can go broke!

This allowed me to build on what I learned making the war card game
simulation. I got a better understanding of OOP, and was able to add a
real player. One of the challenges I came across was having the chip
count roll over to the next round, I was excited to overcome it though!
